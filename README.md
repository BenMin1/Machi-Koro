# Machi-Koro
Machi Koro (Japanese: 街コロ, Hepburn: machi koro, lit. "Dice Town") is a tabletop city-building game designed by Masao Suganuma, illustrated by Noboru Hotta, and published in 2012 by the Japanese games company Grounding, Inc. Players roll dice to earn coins, with which they develop their city, aiming to win the game by being the first player to complete a number of in-game landmarks. Machi Koro has been published in eleven languages, with the U.S version being published by IDW Games and Pandasaurus Games. (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

After playing and enjoying this game for hours, I was inspired to put my coding skills to the test and recreate this game in c++. This project was a great review of classes, functions with pass-by values, and utilized creative iterations of logic to make a functional game. I then used this project as an opportunity to learn more about Python and rewrote the code referencing Google Bard for syntactic questions. Continuing on my journey to learn Python, I created a functional GUI for the game using tkinter. Future plans for this project include creating an AI using machine learning to play the game.
